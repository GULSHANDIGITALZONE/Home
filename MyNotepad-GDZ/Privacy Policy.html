    <h1>Privacy Policy for MyNotepad</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> Jan 19, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>

    <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
    <p>The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our application, MyNotepad, is designed to be a private and secure place for your notes. We do not collect or store any of your personal data on our servers. All your notes and media are stored locally on your device or, if you choose, backed up to your personal Google Drive account.</p>

    <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
    <p>To provide all features, MyNotepad may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> This permission is required to back up and restore your notes from your personal Google Drive account.</li>
        <li><strong>Record Audio:</strong> This permission is required for the Voice Typing feature to transcribe your speech into text. The audio is not stored or sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Media (Images, Video, Audio) / Read External Storage:</strong> This permission is required to allow you to add images, videos, and audio files from your device's storage into your notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Post Notifications:</strong> This permission is required to inform you when a background task, like a backup or restore, is complete. (This is only requested on Android 13 and above).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is yours. We do not have access to your notes, your media, or your Google account information. The app interacts directly with your Google Drive account on your behalf only when you explicitly initiate a backup or restore action.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. Your notes are stored in the app's private directory on your device, which is protected by the Android operating system. When you use the backup feature, your data is transferred securely to your Google Drive, under your own account's security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, You can contact us:</p>
